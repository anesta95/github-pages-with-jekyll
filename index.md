# Welcome to my blog

This is a collection of data analytics and data visualization projects that I have completed. Topics range from sports, economics, politics, and even issues impacting my local community in Washington, DC. Basically, any story that can be made more compelling through data is a story that I am striving to tell.


I hope you find the content interesting! Feel free to fork/access any of the code/data behind any of these projects and don't hesistate to reach out with comments or inquires to: adriannesta@gmail.com
